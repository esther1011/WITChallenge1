            <header>Introduction</header>
            <p>This article attempts to demystify snags in self-learning as the main mode of delivery for the Andela
                Women in Tech Learning Program. Self-learning is learning done by oneself, without a teacher or
                instructor, so it is in itself a plus that what we are having with Andela is “facilitated
                self-learning”. There is so much literature available about self-learning but what I am sharing about is
                unique to the ladies in Cycle 6 of the WIT program because I gathered during the launch that most of us
                were awestruck by the notion of teaching our own selves. </p>

            <header>What does self-learning mean?</header>
            <p>Self-learning is learning done by oneself, without a teacher or instructor. This has especially been made
                easy with the advance of internet; you can learn to do almost anything by simply reading instruction
                manuals, by a simple Google search or by watching a YouTube tutorial.</p>
            <p>In the case of “facilitated self-learning”, Andela takes on the roles of facilitator, that is, by
                Learning Facilitators and organizer providing resources and support to us learners. However it is
                greatly encouraged that learners take more control of their learning process emphasized by the “You own
                your own” learning slogan.</p>

            <header>Why Self-learning is important?</header>
            <p>Although challenging, Self-directed learning has been proven to be effective, convenient, and fast; here
                are some proven advantages;</p>
            <ul>
                <li >Self-learning gives you the ability to identify problems and quickly look for effective solutions on
                    your own. Even with availability of LFs, endeavor to actively look for solutions instead of having
                    solutions brought to you.</li>
                <li >The Learning Experience Becomes More Meaningful; Self-driven learning comes from a personal desire
                    to gain new knowledge. We applied for the WIT program willingly and it will take self-drive to find
                    out more information about our curriculum and use the information for our individual purposes.</li>
                <li >It becomes an adventure and your capabilities are expanded each time you successfully learn
                    something new on your own.</li>
                <li >You don’t have to stick to one mode of learning just because it is what is available. We are
                    encouraged to find what works best for us as a mode of learning whether it’s by mentoring, or
                    discussions; do it and do all that you can do.</li>
                <li >You gain other important skills such as time management, self-assessment, and setting your own
                    goals.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section id="The How of">
            <header>The How of self-learning</header>
            <p>Just because Self learning is fast and convenient does not mean it has no challenges; and one sure way to
                get it done successfully is by having lots of discipline; this is how you may go about it;</p>
            <ul>
                <li >Be in the right frame of mind; understand what you want to learn (programming) and why this subject
                    is important to you. You will need lots of internal motivation so being ready to learn will keep you
                    on track even when your motivation levels are low.</li>
                <li>Have Clear Learning Goals; know the skills and knowledge you want to attain at the end of a lesson;
                    evaluate your progress and see whether you have gained any knowledge.</li>
                <li >Decide Which Tools You Want to Use; you can use the tools provided in the Curriculum and any other
                    as long as learning goals are achieved</li>
                <li>Assessment; Challenges have been given for each week according to course of study and it is
                    important that we complete them as a way of assessing our learning.</li>
            </ul>

        <section id="Self-learning vis">
            <header>Self-learning vis-à-vis self-paced learning</header>
            <p>At the start of my learning process and trying to understand self- learning, I found out that in
                self-learning, you choose what you want to learn when you want to learn, and how you want to learn;
                there is no pressure to learn the required content within a certain time, with the ultimate goal being
                the achievement of high grades. Moreover, great emphasis is put on the process rather than the outcome
                of the learning; this was also echoed by my Learning facilitators.</p>
            <p>Now that I am behind with the submission of my weekly challenges, I find that I am a victim of
                misconstruing self-learning with self-paced learning. WIT is a six weeks program, therefore it is
                time-bound and if I hope to receive my certificate at the end of the six weeks I need to revise by
                goals, strike a balance and while at it; get me some time management skills.</p>

        <section id="Pract">
            <header>Practice</header>
            <p>One of the most important disciplines in the science of developing software is practice, for those who
                have a tech background and novices alike. To drive my point home, I shall equate programming to driving
                a car, if you take a while without sitting behind the wheel, the next time you do it, you will be rusty.
                The same goes for programming, practice as often as you can to avoid rustiness. And it goes without
                saying, practice makes perfect.</p>
            <p>Besides, for most skilling programs, there is always a question of; what next after acquiring the skill?
                Well, fortunate enough Andela has continuous programs like boot camp and the upcoming Super girl
                initiative. This is all good, and whether you make it through to these programs or you don’t, I hope
                that with my car driving correlation I have been able to impress upon you the importance of practice in
                programming.</p>
